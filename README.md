# javabank
Inspired by https://github.com/thejamesthomas/javabank. However, totally redeveloped.
In particular:
- mavenized
- adapted to java 11
- REST-client replaced with native java HttpClient  

Added support of some mountebank features that are missed in the original project:
- ability to create an imposter with https protocol
- behaviors: wait, repeat and copy
